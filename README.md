# Private Snippets by Brian Uceda

This extension allows you to use custom snippets specific to each project and programming language.

## Features

- Loads snippets from `.vscode/snippets/*.json` files
- Support for language-specific snippets (e.g., `java.json` will only work in Java files)
- Support for global snippets with `all.json`
- Dynamic snippet reloading when switching between files

## How to Use

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for `Add New Snippet`
2. Select a language from the dropdown or choose "Custom..." to specify a custom language
3. For global snippets that work in all languages, select "all" from the language options
4. Edit the generated snippet file according to your needs

The extension automatically creates the `.vscode/snippets/` folder and snippet files as needed.
